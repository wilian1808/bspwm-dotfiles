          <p class="disclaimer">
            This tutorial is clearly aimed for beginners only for getting
            started with window managers and I apologize for not making this in
            my github repo's readme since I dont know how to make the readme
            look non-messy/clean , to go on with this tutorial you will need my
            configs and those are in this
            <a href="https://github.com/siduck76/bspwm-dotfiles ">repo. </a>
          </p>

          <h1>Installing and setting up bspwm</h1>
          <p class="captions">
            bspwm is simple , it just needs 2 config files : 1) bspwmrc 2)
            sxhkdrc . Install the packages for your distro : ( click the buttons below )
          </p>

          <div class="distroBtns">
            <button onclick="arch();" class="btns" type="button">
              Arch based
            </button>
            <button onclick="deb();" class="btns" type="button">
              Debian based
            </button>
            <button onclick="fed();" class="btns" type="button">fedora</button>
            <button onclick="voidd();" class="btns" type="button">void</button>
          </div>
          <p class="commands">
            sudo pacman -S feh bspwm sxhkd maim xclip picom ttf-font-awesome rofi 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="captions">clone my repo for the configs :</p>
        <p class="commands">
          git clone https://github.com/siduck76/bspwm-dotfiles
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="captions">
          Oki so to run bspwm you need two files : bspwmrc and sxhkd . bspwmrc
          file is needed for auto-starting apps , like if you want browser to
          open up straight after you start up system then you have to put the
          browser's run command in the bspwmrc file , like for firefox you would
          have to add firefox & at the end of the bspwmrc file !. <br /><br />
          Now the second file which is sxhkdrc is needed for keybinds ( keyboard
          shortcuts ) from my config example :  like if you want if to open terminal by Super which is also called Mod or Mod4 in some window managers ( windows key
          ) + enter then you would have to specify it in the sxhkdrc file.
          example : <br />
        </p>

        <div class="sx"><img class="sxx" src="screenshots/sx.png" /></div>
        <!--    </p> -->
        <br />
        <br />
        <p class="captions">
          # Now copy the bspwmrc / sxhkdrc files ( from my repo which you cloned
          )
        </p>

        <p class="commands">
          mkdir ~/.config/bspwm && mkdir ~/.config/sxhkd <br />
          <br />
          # copy the bspwmrc file to bspwm folder and sxhkdrc file to the sxhkd
          folder <br />
          <br />
          chmod +x bspwmrc ( this is important since bspwmrc  runs everything in bspwm )
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="captions"># apply wallpaper ( feh should be installed )</p>

        <p class="commands">
          # put this line below in your bspwmrc <br /><br />
          feh --bg-fill yourwallpaper
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="captions">
          # add picom for basic fade and smooth transitions ( be sure that picom
          package is installed )
        </p>
        <p class="captions" style="text-align: center">without picom</p>
        <div class="vidFlex">
          <video class="vid" width="74%" controls autoplay>

        </div>
        <p class="captions" style="text-align: center">with picom</p>
        <br />

        <div class="vidFlex">

            <br />
          </video>
        </div>

        <p class="commands">
          copy the picom folder from my ( cloned repo ) to your ~/.config folder
          , that .config folder ends with a dot [ period ] so its hidden , type
          ctrl + h to view it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p class="captions">
          # Now lets look at the sxhkrc file for basic configuration of keyboard
          shortcuts

        <div class="sx"><img class="sxx" src="screenshots/sxh.png" /></div>
        <br />
        <p class="captions">
          # The first two commands in it are for programs , xst is a terminal
          and rofi is an application launcher , so pressing Mod + enter will
          open up xst terminal and so on .The 3rd and 4th commands are for
          reloading the configs , so after every change you make in sxhkrc or
          bspwmrc file you have to reload their configs!( super + shift + e to restart bspwm and super + shift + r to reload sxhkdrc! ) just replace xst with
          any terminal ( from the sxhdkrc file ) you like and the rest of the
          commands are for controlling brightness and  quit bspwm / restart / closing / kill windows.
          <br>

        <p class="captions"> # Now lets check the bspwmrc file </p>
        <div class="sx" >  <img style="border:5px solid #fbbedf;" src="screenshots/bsp.png"> </div><br> 
        <p class="captions"> # Anything you write in this file ( its a script actually ) will be executed when you start bspwm !<br><br> So
        the first line , which is sxhkd starts sxhkd ( daemon ) which will enable all the keyboard shortcuts . and the next ones 
        are just for setting wallpaper , picom , and xresources theme ( this is used for setting colors/fonts for some terminals ) .<br><br>
      #  The next few lines are for setting window border color / width / window  gap size /  and adding new rules to bspwm which means 
        the app you want will be opened in the specifc workspace ( in floating mode or any mode you want )in this case gimp will be 
        opened in the workspace 8 and it will be set to floating automatically. there are 10 workspaces in bspwm . <br> 
        <br> # The bspc config top padding thing in the bottom line is just for adding padding on your top screen so it'd make 
        some space for the panel or such.<br> <br>
       
        # I think you should be familiar with the two files : bspwmrc and sxhkdrc so make a keybind for opening any browser in 
        the sxhdkrc file , when done proceed to the following section.<br> <br> 

        # Bspwm doesnt come with any panel / bar by default so you have to add it . We'll be using polybar in this section . Download
        polybar package for your distro !.

        <p class="commands"> # Now copy my polybar folder ( from my repo ofc ) to your ~/.config folder or you can use the default 
        polybar and configure it yourself. <br><br>
        # To use the default polybar config : <br> <br>
        mkdir ~/.config/polybar   (this will make polybar folder) <br> <br> 
        cp -r /usr/local/share/doc/polybar/config ~/.config/polybar  ( this will copy the default polybar config ) <br><br>
        If the above command doesnt work then : <br> <br> 
        cp -r /usr/share/doc/polybar/config ~/.config/polybar <br><br> </p>
        <p class="captions"> #   If you used the default polybar config then you should be able to run it by : polybar barname , in the default config case
        the barname is example , so add this : polybar example , to your bspwmrc file so polybar runs after startup automatically . </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bolder;">  OR </p>

        <p class="captions"> # If you used my polybar config then , simply add this in your bspwmrc : ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh <br><br>
         My polybar config has two files : config and launch.sh . the config file has all the modules , fonts etc stuffs and the launch.sh
         file just reads the polybar barname from the config file and runs it . <br> <br>

         # If some fonts on polybar ( my config ) dont work then probably you need to install fontawesome5 fonts  and  <a href="https://github.com/siduck76/matfonts"> fonts</a> used by my polybar. Just put all the files from my font repo to your ~/.local/share/fonts folder and then do : fc-cache -fv . If there's no fonts folder then create it ! .
         <br> <br> 
         # If the wifi module doesnt work on the polybar then check your wlan interface's name ( type iwconfig to know it ) and replace it with mine under config .

In this tutorial we'll be using xresources which is config file used to set colors / fonts for urxvt / xterm and other terminals . 
        I use ST  with xresources patch , copy the st folder somewhere and  run these : cd stfolder ,  make && sudo make install . This will install
        st to the system. <br> <br>
        # Put the xresources  in any folder you want and run : xrdb merge Xresources . copy the xrdb command you just executed to 
        your bspwmrc file . <br> <br>
