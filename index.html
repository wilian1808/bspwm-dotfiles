          <p class="disclaimer">
            This tutorial is clearly aimed for beginners only for getting
            started with window managers and I apologize for not making this in
            my github repo's readme since I dont know how to make the readme
            look non-messy/clean , to go on with this tutorial you will need my
            configs and those are in this
            <a href="https://github.com/siduck76/bspwm-dotfiles ">repo  </a> or you can follow up the tutorial and use the default configs.

          <h1>Installing and setting up bspwm</h1>
          <p class="captions">
            bspwm is simple , it just needs 2 config files : 1) bspwmrc 2)
            sxhkdrc . Install the packages for your distro : ( click the buttons below )
          </p>

          <div class="distroBtns">
            <button onclick="arch();" class="btns" type="button">
              Arch based
            </button>
            <button onclick="deb();" class="btns" type="button">
              Debian based
            </button>
            <button onclick="fed();" class="btns" type="button">fedora</button>
            <button onclick="voidd();" class="btns" type="button">void</button>
          </div>
          <p class="commands">
            sudo pacman -S feh bspwm sxhkd maim xclip picom ttf-font-awesome rofi 
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="captions">clone my repo for the configs :</p>
        <p class="commands">
          git clone https://github.com/siduck76/bspwm-dotfiles
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="captions">
          Oki so to run bspwm you need two files : bspwmrc and sxhkd . bspwmrc
          file is needed for auto-starting apps, adding specific rules to certain applications , window border colors / layouts etc, like if you want browser to
          open up straight after you start up system then you have to put the
          browser's run command in the bspwmrc file , like for firefox you would
          have to add firefox & at the end of the bspwmrc file !. <br /><br />
          Now the second file which is sxhkdrc is needed for keybinds ( keyboard
          shortcuts ) from my config example :  like if you want if to open terminal by Super which is also called Mod or Mod4 in some window managers ( windows key
          ) + enter then you would have to specify it in the sxhkdrc file.
          example : <br />

          # Now copy the bspwmrc / sxhkdrc files ( from my repo which you cloned
          )
        </p>

        <p class="commands">
          
          mkdir ~/.config/bspwm && mkdir ~/.config/sxhkd ( this will create two folders needed to store bspwmrc and sxhkdrc ) <br />
          <br />
          # copy the bspwmrc file to bspwm folder and sxhkdrc file  to the sxhkd folder ( bspwmrc and sxhkdrc from my git repo if you want or use the default ones )
            <br /><br>
          
          # if you want to use the default bspwmrc and sxhkdrc file then copy it this way : <br> <br>
          cp -r /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm/  <br> <br> 
          cp -r /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/<br> 
          <br />
          # give permissions to the bspwmrc file <br> <br>
          chmod +x bspwmrc ( this is important since bspwmrc  runs everything in bspwm )
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="captions"># apply wallpaper ( feh should be installed )</p>

          reloading the configs , so after every change you make in sxhdkrc or
          bspwmrc file you have to reload their configs!( super + shift + e to restart bspwm and super + shift + r to reload sxhkdrc! ) just replace xst with
          any terminal ( from the sxhdkrc file ) you like and the rest of the
          commands are for controlling brightness and  quit bspwm / restart / closing / kill windows.

         file just reads the polybar barname from the config file and runs it . <br> <br>

         # If some fonts on polybar ( my config ) dont work then probably you need to install fontawesome5 fonts  and  <a href="https://github.com/siduck76/matfonts"> fonts</a> used by my polybar. Just put all the files from my font repo to your ~/.local/share/fonts folder and then do : fc-cache -fv . If there's no fonts folder then create it ! .
